Suppose you are a competent medical researcher. 
You want to develop an algorithm that can predict whether a person with COVID-19 will become critically ill by investigating the risk factors for predicting the progression of the disease to critical illness and the weight of each risk factor. 
Read the documentation I have provided, and fill in the empty values in the following json template. 
If it appears that there is no information for that key, put "None" for value.
To answer the question, your response must reflect all the necessary information from the paper. 
An answer consisting of a few short sentences should be assigned to value. 
You should only return a json template with the value filled in. You should not return any other text. 
Think step by step and fill in the values one by one.
